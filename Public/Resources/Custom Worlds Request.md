Hi there, you wish to have more custom content? With custom rewards? I introduce you the custom world request!

Here you will, using a pre-defined sheet, write your quest and it's details, the quest can be based on your story or other characters you wish to know/introduce. It can even be a playable flashback!

It can also be a escape from the current main story and be it's own separate story. How? Simple.

## Requirements:

- Your Character must be LVL 4;
- Your Character must have completed the Story Quest: Siege;
- The Character must then complete the Side Quest: Games?;

After completing this quest on any tavern/inn you may request up to 3 other characters, (Friendship LVL Companion or Higher), to come play a Story Telling game with you, there you will venture to the side quest.

You will still be able to earn a custom reward depending on how long/difficult the Quest is.

## Making the quest:

```
# Requirements
--------------
[T]Theme: (What is the story about in a broad perspective.)
[N]Name: (Name of the side story.)
[E]Expected Duration: (How long the quest takes? In-Quest days.)
[O]Objectives: (What are the main objectives)
[W]World: (If non-dnd base, what is the world this quest takes place in?)
--------------
### Advancing...
Good job using this previous steps I will be able to understand the basics to start working on it, however now I request you to do 1 task.
--------------
## Making a Character Sheet
Please tell/request me the details that you wish to use for this specific story character creation.

For example: Name/Age/Magic/etc...
The Bartender of the respective Inn will be the DM of the custom story if you wish, otherwise it can be a story without narrator.

[Yes Narrator]/[No Narrator]

Remember the CS is the most important part as having a compelling characters makes it more likely I won't drop out of the story.
---------------
### Last details
Even tho ur character is roleplaying the game in a in, the ingame story doesnt require the character to use the same personality traits.

Leveling inside the Custom Story will be using my paid discord XP bot which is already in the server, so current levels will be reset.

If you wish to hand out a custom item in the end to all party members this items will be like a layer to your current equipment, meaning they only use the aspect, no stats.
```

## Quest Example:

[T]Theme: Magic School
[N]Name: That day I became the best hero!
[E]Expected Duration: 1 day
[O]Objectives: Kill the Villain Bubu
[W]World: My Hero Academia
[S]Story: When I was going to my school, it was attacked by a villain called Bubu, bla bla bla  bla bla, and my class and I defeat it becoming full pro-heroes! YEY!

//Please elaborate more ;-; This is just an example so I have an idea of what u want, otherwise the story will be fully made by me if you leave the S of story completely empty. Unless you really like my plots and stories write your own.//
